# The OSI Model

## Mental Tool
- The OSI model serves as a mental tool for techs to pinpoint network issues quickly by identifying the specific OSI layer involved.

## Common Language:
- It establishes a standardized language for techs to describe and troubleshoot network functions consistently and clearly.

## Purpose of a Networking Model
- **Simplification:** The OSI model simplifies networking by breaking down complex processes into discrete layers, making it easier to design and troubleshoot networks.
- **Compatibility:** Facilitates collaboration between software and hardware creators, ensuring that devices and applications from different vendors work together seamlessly.

## Note on ISO and the OSI Model
- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the OSI seven-layer model to standardize network architecture globally, promoting interoperability among network devices and systems.

## OSI Seven-Layer Model
- **Each Layer's Role:** Defines specific functions in data communication and network operation.
- **Protocols:** Sets of rules and standards that enable hardware and software developers to create compatible devices and applications.
- **Layers of the OSI Model:**
  - Layer 7: Application
  - Layer 6: Presentation
  - Layer 5: Session
  - Layer 4: Transport
  - Layer 3: Network
  - Layer 2: Data Link
  - Layer 1: Physical

## Layer 1: Physical Layer
- **Data Transmission:** Defines methods (cabling, fiber optics, radio waves) for physically moving data between devices.
- **Focus:** Concerned with the reliable transfer of raw data bits across the network medium.

## Network Interface Cards (NICs)
- **Role in Networking:** NICs serve as the interface between computers (PCs) and the network infrastructure, facilitating physical connections.
- **Functionality:** Provides unique identifiers (MAC addresses) for devices to communicate within the network.
- **Data Handling:** Transmits and receives binary data in the form of electrical, light, or radio signals.
- **Frames:** NICs create and read discrete chunks of data known as frames, which include headers (MAC addresses and type), payload (data), and trailers (Frame Check Sequence - FCS).

## Hub vs. Switch
- **Hubs:** Basic network devices that broadcast data to all connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient.
- **Switches:** Intelligent devices that selectively forward data frames to the specific device based on its MAC address, improving network efficiency.

## Frame Check Sequence (FCS)
- **Data Integrity:** Uses a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) to verify the accuracy of transmitted data. Frames with errors (mismatched CRC) are discarded to prevent data corruption.

## Addressing and Broadcasts
- **MAC Address Retrieval:** Systems use broadcast frames (FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF) to request unknown MAC addresses from other devices on the network.
- **Data Transmission Process:** The sending system's operating system prepares data, which is then formatted into a frame by the NIC. The frame includes MAC addresses, FCS, and data payload before transmission. Upon reception, the receiving NIC processes the frame based on the MAC address and forwards data to the OS if matched.

## Data Link Layer
- **MAC Operations:** Manages MAC addresses to ensure proper data delivery within the local network segment.
- **Layer Interaction:** NICs operate at both the Data Link and Physical layers, bridging the gap between hardware and software protocols.

## Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC)
- **LLC:** Communicates with the system's operating system, handling multiple protocols and flow control.
- **MAC:** Responsible for creating and addressing frames, ensuring accurate and efficient transmission of data across the network.

## Layer 3: Network Layer
- **IP and Packet Routing:** Uses logical IP addresses for network communication. Routers utilize IP addresses to forward data packets between different networks, bypassing MAC addresses when necessary.
- **Data Packaging:** Data is encapsulated into packets and frames for efficient transmission across networks. Routers strip and reassemble data packets as they traverse through different network segments.

## Layer 4: Transport Layer
- **Segmentation and Reassembly:** Breaks data into manageable segments (TCP) for transmission and reassembles them upon receipt. Uses sequence numbers to ensure proper data ordering and requests retransmission of lost or corrupted segments.
- **Connection Types:** TCP (connection-oriented) guarantees data delivery by establishing a reliable connection and verifying data integrity before transmission. UDP (connectionless) sends data without establishing a connection, suitable for real-time applications where speed is crucial.
- **Segment Details:** The Transport layer creates TCP segments with source and destination ports, ensuring data reaches the correct application.

## Layer 5: Session Layer
- **Session Management:** Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions between applications. Manages dialogue control and synchronization, ensuring seamless data exchange between endpoints.

## Layer 6: Presentation Layer
- **Data Translation:** Translates data formats between different layers of the OSI model and the Application layer. Ensures compatibility and seamless data exchange between different systems and applications.

## Layer 7: Application Layer
- **Application Interface:** Provides network services directly to user applications, enabling them to interact with the network and utilize network resources efficiently.

## Encapsulation and Decapsulation
- **Encapsulation:** Prepares data for network transmission by adding necessary headers (protocol information, addresses) at each OSI layer. Each layer adds specific information to the data as it moves down the OSI stack.
- **Decapsulation:** Removes headers and protocol information from received data as it moves up the OSI stack. Each layer interprets and processes the relevant information before passing it to the upper layer.

## Bottom Line
- The OSI seven-layer model provides a systematic approach to conceptualize network architecture and troubleshoot connectivity issues. Its structured framework is essential for understanding both basic and complex network environments, ensuring efficient network management and troubleshooting.
