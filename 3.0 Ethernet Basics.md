# Ethernet Basics

## Main Idea

Ethernet technology enables high-speed data transfer between computers, revolutionizing networking.

---

## Historical Context

- **Before Ethernet:**
  - Manual file transfers using disks were prevalent before Ethernet.
- **Need for Ethernet:**
  - To automate and speed up data transfer between computers.

---

## Evolution of Ethernet

- **Xerox's Ethernet:**
  - The initial version used coaxial cable and operated at 3 Mbps, setting the stage for subsequent advancements.
- **DIX Standard:**
  - Established a collaborative standard that promoted interoperability and adoption across different manufacturers.
- **IEEE 802.3:**
  - The ongoing standardization effort by IEEE ensured continuous improvement and adaptation of Ethernet to meet evolving networking needs.

## Ethernet Frames

- **Frame Structure:**
  - **Preamble:** A 7-byte series for synchronization to prepare the network devices for an incoming frame.
  - **MAC Address:** A unique identifier for network interface cards (NICs), essential for directing data to the correct recipient.
  - **Type Field:** Indicates the type of data being transported, such as IPv4 or IPv6.
  - **Data:** The payload, which contains the actual information being transmitted, along with additional protocol information.
  - **Pad:** Used to ensure the frame reaches a minimum size of 64 bytes.
  - **FCS:** The Frame Check Sequence uses a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection.

## Early Ethernet Standards

- **Bus Topology:**
  - Early Ethernet used a true bus topology where all computers connected to a single cable, making it prone to collisions.
- **10BASE-T:**
  - **Speed:** Operated at 10 Mbps.
  - **Cable:** Utilized Cat 3 or higher unshielded twisted pair (UTP) cabling.
  - **Connector:** Used RJ-45 connectors.
  - **Mode:** Initially supported half-duplex operation, later supporting full-duplex for improved performance.

---

## Network Cabling

- **UTP Cabling:**
  - Consisted of Cat 3 or higher, with 4 pairs of twisted wires, often including Kevlar fibers for additional strength.
- **RJ-45 Connector:**
  - An 8P8C modular plug, essential for connecting devices in a network.
  - **Wiring Standards:** TIA/EIA 568A and 568B standards dictate the correct pin configurations for reliable connections.

---

## Advanced Cabling Techniques

- **UTP Cabling:**
  - Commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness and ease of installation, with additional strength provided by Kevlar fibers.
- **RJ-45 Wiring Standards:**
  - Adhering to TIA/EIA 568A and 568B standards ensures correct pin assignments and reliable network connections.

## CSMA/CD

- **Collision Detection:**
  - Devices check the cable before transmitting to avoid collisions, and if a collision occurs, they wait a random time before retrying.
- **Collision Handling:**
  - Retransmission is attempted after a random delay, helping to mitigate the impact of collisions on network performance.

---

## Enhancing Ethernet

- **Switches:**
  - Replaced hubs, creating individual collision domains for each connection, thereby reducing collisions and improving network efficiency.
- **Switching Loops:**
  - Prevented using the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), which ensures a loop-free network topology.
- **Uplink Ports:**
  - Used for connecting switches to other switches or routers, with modern switches supporting auto-sensing to detect and configure the connection type automatically.
- **Crossover Cables:**
  - Employed to reverse the sending and receiving pairs, facilitating direct device-to-device connections without a switch or hub.

---

## Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)

- **Function:**
  - Prevents network loops by using BPDU (Bridge Protocol Data Unit) frames to establish and maintain a loop-free topology.
- **BPDU Frames:**
  - Special frames exchanged between switches to determine the network's logical layout and prevent loops.
- **PortFast and BPDU Guard:**
  - Configurations that optimize network performance by preventing potential loops and ensuring rapid transition of ports to the forwarding state.

---

## Network Switches and STP

- **Switches:**
  - Modern switches create separate collision domains for each connection, buffer frames, and provide more efficient network traffic management compared to hubs.
- **Spanning Tree Protocol:**
  - Uses BPDUs to establish a loop-free network, with a root bridge designated to control the network topology and manage topology changes.
- **PortFast and BPDU Guard:**
  - Optimizations that help improve network performance and prevent accidental loops by quickly transitioning ports to forwarding state and protecting the network from rogue BPDU transmissions.

## Troubleshooting Ethernet Networks

- **Common Issues:**
  - Physical damage to cables, dead ports, and faulty connections are common problems in Ethernet networks.
- **Steps:**
  1. Identify connectivity problems through physical inspection and network testing.
  2. Inspect for physical damage, such as cuts or breaks in cables.
  3. Check link lights on devices to ensure they indicate active connections.
  4. Examine and replace faulty cables with known-good ones.
  5. Replace non-functional components, such as damaged network interface cards or defective switches.
